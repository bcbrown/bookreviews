# Short reviews of the books I've read in 2016

### Language in Thought and Action
One of the more influential books, which I first read about a decade ago. The chapter on the similarities between poetry and modern advertising is fantastic.

### How To Read a Book
I thought I should put this one towards the front of the year, since I planned to read a lot of books. More interesting and thoughtful than perhaps the name implies, it discusses how to efficiently understand what an author is saying, through first skimming, then reading, then summarizing. I've found it a useful tool; although I only fully apply its methods to a few books, I use a lot of its techniques, such as carefully reading the table of contents, and identifying main theses.

>"Full ownership of a book only comes when you have made it a part of yourself, and the best way to make yourself a part of it - which comes to the same thing - is by writing in it. p49

>"The best protection against propaganda of any sort is the recognition of it for what it is. Only hidden and undetected oratory is really insidious. What reaches the heart without going through the mind is likely bounce back and put the mind out of business. Propaganda taken that way is like a drug you do not know you are swallowing. The effect is mysterious; you do not know afterwards why you feel or think the way you do. P194

### Gilgamesh
>An easy-reading, beautiful story.  I read Stephen Mitchell's translation.

### Beowulf
Another classic saga, beautifully translated by Seamus Heaney. 
>"He ignores the shape of things to come." P121. 

>"Foreign places yield more to one who is himself worth meeting." P127

### Snowcrash
I reread this sci-fi classic for the first time since high school. It's definitely more suited for an adolescent frame of mind, but it's still a fun, rollicking adventure. This is the book that introduces the concept of virtual "avatars".

### High Output Management
In this book Andy Grove, the former CEO of Intel, discusses how to manage efficiently. Although I'm not a manager per se, it's worthwhile reading for most knowledge workers, including anyone who schedules or attends meetings.

### Hell's Angels
One of Hunter S Thompson's first published books that I haven't reread since high school, this is from before he's developed his gonzo voice. An entertaining account of spending a year hanging out with the Hells Angels, and going on rides with them. Tom Wolfe borrowed his notes for this book for parts of The Electric Koolaid Acid Test.

### Programming Pearls
This book has come highly recommended from many people, yet I found it underwhelming and dated. I'm not sorry I read it, though.

### Walden
Transcendentalism was my literary specialty in college, and I wrote a small thesis on Walden. It was very enjoyable to revisit this book.

>"The universe is wider than our views of it."

>"What if all ponds were shallow? Would it not react on the minds of men? I am thankful that this pond was made deep and pure for a symbol. While men believe in the infinite some ponds will be thought to be bottomless."

>"For I was rich, if not in money, in sunny hours and summer days, and spent them lavishly."

>"This is a delicious evening, when the whole body is one sense, and imbibes delight through every pore."

### Autobiography of Red
One of my new favorites. A poetic novel inspired by Stesichoros's account of one of Hercules's twelve labors, which involved killing a monster, Geryon, and taking his winged cattle. It's set in quasi-modern times, and is from the point of view of Geryon. Read this quote, and if you are not unmoved, get your hands on a copy as soon as you can:

```
 "Like the terrestrial crust of the earth
 which is proportionately ten times thinner than an eggshell, the skin of the soul
 is a miracle of mutual pressures." P60
 ```

### Letters From a Stoic
One of the three foundational texts for Stoicism, I found a lot that resonated with me. Highly recommended for whenever life throws you a curveball.

>"What cause can there be for complaint, after all, in anything that was always bound to come to an end fading gradually away?" P70

### Three Body Problem
Modern Chinese sci-fi, first in a trilogy. A compelling read; I started it on a Saturday afternoon, and finished it by Sunday night. It made me want to learn more about the Cultural Revolution.

### Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus
Dense and enigmatic, although I understood less than a tenth of what Wittgenstein had to say, by the end I felt a flash of understanding. I look forward to revisiting this book, as well as his Philosophical Investigations.

>"The limits of my language mean the limits of my world." P88

>"If by eternity it is understood no endless temporal duration but timelessness, then he lives eternally who lives in the present." P106

### Tyranny of Words
An interesting book from the 30s, it is written as a sort of layman's exposition of the ideas expressed by Korzybski, Ogden, and Richards. A better, more modern treatment is Language in Thought and Action, listed first.

### The Golden Mean
A fascinating novel about the years where Aristotle tutored the adolescent Alexander the Great, with richly developed characters and a lively plot.

### Disrupted
A funny expose about the vagaries of startup life, written by a deeply bitter and somewhat dislikeable former journalist who worked at a startup for a year after getting laid off from Newsweek.

### Big Data
A presentation of an architecture for large-scale data processing systems. I deeply disagree with the author's design choices in several fundamental ways, but it's still a worthwhile read.

### Practical OO Design in Ruby
Worthwhile for anyone building systems in Ruby, or as an introduction to object-oriented programming in general.

### Brave New World
I had somehow never read this book before, and found it of value mainly for its historical, cultural value. If you haven't read the quote by Neil Postman comparing the world depicted in Brave New World to 1984's, it's well worth seeking out.

### Rilke: Sonnets to Orpheus, Duino Elegies
I put this as a combined entry because they're combined, they're still a very fast read. Rilke has been one of my favorite poets ever since I was first exposed to him in high school, and I frequently revisit his poetry. It's hard to choose a quote, because every line speaks to me, so I won't.

### Anatomy of a City
This book covers every aspect of municipal services in New York, from water and sewage to roadways and fire hydrants. An interesting read if you like knowing how stuff works.

### Infrastructure
Similarly, but nationwide, and focusing on the systems that are hidden away away from cities, like power plants, quarries, and refineries. Better than Anatomy of a City, this is written by a photographer, and contains a lot of fantastic photographs.

### Language and Thought, Chomsky
A wierd little book that appears to be a transcript of a talk he gave on this topic. I'm going to need to reread it to get much out of it.

### Hero of a Thousand Faces
I've known about Joseph Campbell and his theory of mythologies since high school, but never read his work before. I really enjoyed it, and afterwards picked up a bunch of mythologies to read. This is essentially a ton of excerpts from and summaries of myths and fairy tales, organized by topic, in order to show the commonalities amongst them.

### Language and Responsibility
An introduction to Chomsky's generative grammar, in the form of an interview by a French linguist. As I've never studied linguistics before, I found it hard to understand much, but I feel like I now have the necessary context for future readings.

### Magic, Science, Religion
A collection of essays by Malinowski, who pioneered field-based anthropology in the Trobriand Islands of the South Pacific. I picked this up for his discussion of language and thought, but was also struck by his definition of the difference between magic and religion. In short, magic has an definite end in mind: I want my fishing expedition to be fruitful, or my garden to grow well, etc. If I perform this spell, this outcome will happen. Religious rituals, in contrast, have no such guarantee.

>"The beginning of man is the beginning of articulate thought and of thought put into action. Without words, whether framed in sober rational conversation, or launched in magical spells, or used to entreat superior divinities, man would not have been able to embark upon his great Odyssey of cultural adventure and achievement." P148

### Meditations
A second foundational Stoic text, the personal journal of Marcus Aurelius, emperor of Rome.

>"Your soul takes on the color of your thoughts." P59

>"Awaken; return to yourself. Now, no longer asleep, knowing they were only dreams, clear-headed again, treat everything around as a dream." P76

>"It's normal to feel pain in your hands and feet, if your using your feet as feet and your hands as hands. And for a human being to feel stress is normal - if he's living a normal human life.

>And if it's normal, how can it be bad?" P76

>"You can hold your breath until you turn blue, but they'll still go on doing it." P102
>"Leave other people's mistakes where they lie." P122

### Oranges
The first book I read by John McPhee, I picked it up on a whim at a used bookstore, after having heard great things from several people about him. As a review quoted on the back cover says, "This is a surprising book. You may come to the end of it and say to yourself, 'But I *can't* have read a whole book about oranges! But the chances are you will have done so ... It's a delicious book, in a word, and more absorbing than many a novel." That's entirely true, and after finishing the book a day or two later, I went back and bought the rest of the McPhees at that bookstore. He has a keen eye for observation, and the ability to craft a compelling narrative out of almost anything.

### The Dream of the Englightment
A survey of 8 important philosophers of the Enlightment, plust the important context surrounding their works. Having no prior exposure to any of them, I now have a decent sense of what Hobbes, Locke, Spinoza and others were all about.

### The Nonexistant Knight / The Cloven Viscount
A pair of novellas by Italo Calvino, both hilarious Midieval farces. I look forward to reading the rest of his bibliography.

### The Deltoid Pumpkin Seed
The second John McPhee book I read, about test flights for an airplane/zeppelin hybrid. Not quite as compelling as Oranges, but still very good.
>"Money is life translated into exchangeable value."

### Peopleware
A book about managing software products and teams of programmers from the 80s, about half the book is now dated, while the other half is still relevant.
