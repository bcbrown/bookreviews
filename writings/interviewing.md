System design interview prep

There's a book that I have, but haven't read yet, called System Design Interview by Alex Xu. That's a good starting point for prep.

Another prep strategy is to seek out blog posts and recorded talks by engineers at large companies talking about the design of their systems. Don't just read/watch, though. Before you do so, sketch out how you'd design the system under discussion. Then, after reading or watching, compare the actual design with yours.

For algorithm design interviews, a piece of advice I've commonly heard is to start with a "toolbag" of techniques, including data structures like trees, heaps, queues, etc. When you hear the question, first ask yourself if it should be solved with a tree, etc. Similarly for systems questions, build a toolbag of all the common components that can in a block diagram. This will be things like caches, load balancers, databases, queues, logs, etc.

Before the interview, try to design each of the systems in the prospective company's products, then compare with architectural talks and blogs; often a system design interview will be for a publicly-known internal system. If you have time and know who will be on your interview loop, take the time to look them up on LinkedIn and see what companies they've worked at previously; it's possible your interviewer will take the design question from one of the systems at a previous employer.
