# Short reviews of the books I've read in 2017

### Theory of Semiotics, Umberto Eco
Probably the densest book I've ever read.

### Trout Fishin in America, Richard Brautigan

### The City and the City
One of the more thought-provoking novels I've read lately, it made me think
about what it means to see and not see in urban living.

### Effective Python
Not much new, but a very good overview of good practices in Python for 
intermediate programmers looking to get started with more advanced techniques.

### The Sun Also Rises, Hemingway
It took some time to get going, but by the end it wsa captivating.

### Inimitable Jeeves
### Very Good, Jeeves
### Right Ho, Jeeves!
If you've never read any P.G. Wodehouse, I highly encourage to go out and
order any of his Jeeves novels right now. Set in England, they're entertaining
farces about the life and exploits of a member of London's idle rich, Bertie
Wooster, and his butler, Jeeves. They're perfect before-bed reading.

### General Systems Thinking
A more rigorous treatment of the same subject as The Systems Bible, this is
a book to which I expect I'll often reread.

### Confederacy of Dunces
Several people to whom I've talked about this book found it revolting when
they tried reading it. I found it a highly enjoyable tale about wholly
unlikeable characters.

### Too Like the Lightning
### Seven Surrenders
Too Like the Lightning is an engaging sci-fi novel, mixed with Enlightment
philosophy and some fantasy. I read both and it's sequel, Seven Surrenders,
over separate 24-hour periods. The sequel isn't quite as good, but still
worthwhile.

### A Personal Anthology, Borges
Deeply weird and though-provoking short stories, plus short essays and poems,
this collection was chosen by Jorge Luis Borges as the works he wanted his
legacy judged by. This was perfectly suited to be read on the bus on the way
to and from work.

### Hard-boiled Wonderland
Highly enjoyable and deeply original. There's two separate storylines that
eventually join together; in one of them, there's a single small town,
alone and surrounded by wilderness, where in order to enter, the gatekeeper
must cut your shadow off and leave it outside.

### Forest Unseen
I had read most of this a couple years ago, and picked it up and finished
it this year. A series of short essays on nature, spurred by repeated
visits to the same one-foot circle of forest in Tennessee, by a biologist.

### Proust and the Squid
A book on the neurology of reading, as well as an exploration of dyslexia,
of which I have a variant. I found it quite interesting.

### Dark Forest
The sequel to the Three Body Problem, I found it almost as good, and I'm looking
forward to the third.

### Merchant of Venice
I forgot just how anti-semitic this play was.

### The Tempest
I remember this being my favorite play by Shakespeare when I was in high school,
and this rereading didn't disappoint.

### King Lear

### Watermelon Sugar
Richard Brautigan is one of the several most important literary influences in
my life. He is one of the few authors to whom I turn when I can't sleep, or I
when I'm looking for something to read for a half hour in the hammock. It's
always worthwhile to reread something of his.

### For Whome The Bell Tolls
My favorite book by Hemingway. The denouement at the canyon bridge is one of
the most tense, gripping scenes in anything I've read. What I like about this
book is how most of the book is spent building up a variety of characters
then shows the inevitable reactions when they're put into a series of 
situations. The writing is very stripped down, but powerfully evocative.

### The Book Of Tea
Some time back, someone important to me introduced me to the pleasures of tea,
especially the variety of loose leaf teas available. This pleasant, short book,
by a Japanese intellectual for an American audience, discusses the history, 
rituals, and aesthetics of tea preparation.

This book is likely most interesting to people who are: inclined towards eastern
mysticism, the poetic aesthics of the Romantics and pastoral poets, and
tea drinkers.

Quote:
Meanwhile, let us have a sip of tea. The afternoon glow is brightening the 
bamboos, the fountains are bubbling with delight, the soughing of the pines is
heard in our kettle. Let us dream of evanescence, and linger in the beautiful
foolishness of things.

### I Am A Strange Loop
I had a close friend move to Berlin this year; we had hoped to have a final
get-together, but never did. I happened to be at the airport, on my way to
San Francisco, when I saw him ahead of me in the security line. We got to
have a beer in the airport before our flights, and sharing my interests in
this sort of book, he gave me `I Am a Strange Loop`, which he had just finished.

I'm a total sucker for that sort of happy happenstance, and it made an already
great book even better. This is a book for the people who think it's really
interesting what happens when you point a video camera at the television it's
hooked up to, or two mirrors in front and behind you, such that you see an
infinity of reflections, alternating between front and back views. It's
an attempt at one definition of consciousness, based on self-referential
patterns.

Written by the author of Godel, Escher, Bach, in many ways this is a sequel,
20+ years later. It's completely nontechnical, and accessible to anyone with an
intellectual curiousity into what it means to be concsious.

### Mind And Nature
Gregory Bateson is perhaps the most thought-provoking writer I've encountered.
If I was to be stuck on a desert island with just one book, this book could be
in my top five. He has a knack for making incredibly profound, original
insights appear obvious and intuitive. The first half of this book should be
required reading at the high school senior or college freshman level. The
second half is unfortunately very dry and academic; it's going to take
multiple readings before I'm able to properly summarize it.

The book starts by taking a series of intuitive observations of the surrounding
natural world, and developing them into highly original insights. It then
proposes a definition of mind, and provides a perspective of nature that
satisfies that definition. It provides both a theory of mind, and a theory of
evolution, that consists of loops across two different levels of abstraction.

If you've ever been intrigued by cybernetics, this would be a good book to
check out.

### Seveneves
For Neal Stephenson's entire career, he's been in need of a good editor. He's
great at setting up a novel, but just can't bring himself to end them. This is
a fantastic, action-packed imagination of what might happen if humanity has
just one year before all life on Earth will be destroyed by meteorites
(loose paraphrase).

### Modern China

### Andy Grove Bio
Not as good as High Output Managment

### Exercises in Style, Raymond Queaneau
Goofy little book of wordplay. The same little scenario played out in many
different styles. Translated from the French, which must have been a
creative feat in itself.

### Iliad
Amazingly bloody. Almost war-porn, but incredibly poetically written.

### Witt Bio
Gave a great view into the man behind the philosophy. I first read
Tractatus, then this, and will next attempt Philosophical Investigations.
I think that's a great way to order these, although Tractatus may be
skippable.

### Technical Leadership
A seminar in a book, the questions at the end of each chapter are almost
as valuable as the rest of the book combined. I can recommend this book
to anyone looking to increase their technical mastery of a skill, from
software development to logging to knitting.

### Behind Closed Doors
Worth reading, but not highly recommended, a book on technical management
of software developers.

### MySQL Stored Programs
You should only read this book if you already know you need to. It was very
helpful for rapidly getting me up to speed in a new job that makes heavy use
of stored procedures in MySQL. It's also 10 years old.

### Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves
I'll be very sad the day I've finished everything written by P.G. Wodehouse.
Until then I'll always have something to look forward to reading. This book
is a single narrative, instead of a series of vignettes. I slightly prefer
the vignettes.
