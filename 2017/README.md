# Short reviews of the books I've read in 2017

### Theory of Semiotics, Umberto Eco
Probably the densest book I've ever read.

### Trout Fishin in America, Richard Brautigan

### The City and the City
One of the more thought-provoking novels I've read lately, it made me think
about what it means to see and not see in urban living.

### Effective Python
Not much new, but a very good overview of good practices in Python for 
intermediate programmers looking to get started with more advanced techniques.

### The Sun Also Rises, Hemingway
It took some time to get going, but by the end it wsa captivating.

### Inimitable Jeeves
### Very Good, Jeeves
### Right Ho, Jeeves!
If you've never read any P.G. Wodehouse, I highly encourage to go out and
order any of his Jeeves novels right now. Set in England, they're entertaining
farces about the life and exploits of a member of London's idle rich, Bertie
Wooster, and his butler, Jeeves. They're perfect before-bed reading.

### General Systems Thinking
A more rigorous treatment of the same subject as The Systems Bible, this is
a book to which I expect I'll often reread.

### Confederacy of Dunces
Several people to whom I've talked about this book found it revolting when
they tried reading it. I found it a highly enjoyable tale about wholly
unlikeable characters.

### Too Like the Lightning
### Seven Surrenders
Too Like the Lightning is an engaging sci-fi novel, mixed with Enlightment
philosophy and some fantasy. I read both and it's sequel, Seven Surrenders,
over separate 24-hour periods. The sequel isn't quite as good, but still
worthwhile.

### A Personal Anthology, Borges
Deeply weird and though-provoking short stories, plus short essays and poems,
this collection was chosen by Jorge Luis Borges as the works he wanted his
legacy judged by. This was perfectly suited to be read on the bus on the way
to and from work.

### Hard-boiled Wonderland
Highly enjoyable and deeply original. There's two separate storylines that
eventually join together; in one of them, there's a single small town,
alone and surrounded by wilderness, where in order to enter, the gatekeeper
must cut your shadow off and leave it outside.

### Forest Unseen
I had read most of this a couple years ago, and picked it up and finished
it this year. A series of short essays on nature, spurred by repeated
visits to the same one-foot circle of forest in Tennessee, by a biologist.

### Proust and the Squid
A book on the neurology of reading, as well as an exploration of dyslexia,
of which I have a variant. I found it quite interesting.

### Dark Forest
The sequel to the Three Body Problem, I found it almost as good, and I'm looking
forward to the third.

### Merchant of Venice
I forgot just how anti-semitic this play was.

### The Tempest
I remember this being my favorite play by Shakespeare when I was in high school,
and this rereading didn't disappoint.
