# Short reviews of the books I've read in 2017

### Theory of Semiotics, Umberto Eco
Probably the densest book I've ever read, and I've read some pretty heavy tomes.
Covering every channel of communication possible, Eco defines the domain of
Semiotics as "studying everything which can be used in order to lie."

> I propose to define as a sign, _everything_ that, on the grounds of a
previously established social convention, can be taken as _something standing
for something else._

The book starts by considering a simple system; there's a dam, with water
behind it, and a control station some distance away. There's a buoy in the
reservoir, which sends a signal causing a red light to be illuminated
when the water level reaches some threshold, and signals the dam operator 
to increase the volume of outflow. Then, to provide some redundancy and
error correction, first two, and then four lights (called A, B, C, and D)
are employed, such that AB is "danger level", BD is "alarm", CD is the
"rest state, no action necessary", and DA is "low water level".

After setting up this scenario, Eco provides four separate systems for
analysing the lights:
- A set of signals ruled by internal combinatory laws (syntactics). This is
solely concerned with what combinations of lights is possible, not about what they _mean_.
- A set of states of the water which can become a set of communicative contents (semantics).
This is independent of what system is used to communicate the information.
- A set of possible behavioral responses. "Communicationally speaking the 
responses are proofs that the message has been correctly received."
- A rule coupling some items from the first with the second or third system.
This is what he terms a code.

### Trout Fishing in America
Richard Brautigan is one of the most important literary influences in
my life. He is one of the few authors to whom I turn when I can't sleep, or I
when I'm looking for something to read for a half hour in the hammock. It's
always worthwhile to reread something of his.

Trout Fishing is a series of
vignettes and meditations, all somewhat loosely connected with trout fishing,
but only loosely. As a blurb on the back cover says, "Reading _Trout Fishing
in America_ won't help you catch more fish, but it does have something to do
with trout fishing." 

> He wore a costume of Trout Fishing in America. He wore mountains on his
elbows and bluejays on the collar of his shirt. Deep water flowed through the
lilies that were entwined about his shoelaces. A bullfrog kept croaking in his
watch pocket and the air was filled with the sweet smell of ripe blackberry
bushes.

### Watermelon Sugar
Also by Richard Brautigan, this is a poetic novella about a land where things
arew made from watermelon sugar. It's very hard to describe, so I'll just say
that Brautigan marries a poetic aesthetic with deadpan comedy in absurdity.

### The City and the City, China Miéville
One of the more thought-provoking novels I've read lately, it made me think
about what it means to see and not see one's surroundings in urban living. It's
a murder mystery in a world of two cities, physically superimposed on each other,
but requiring a trip through Customs to pass from one to the other. When someone
asks me what was the best book I read in 2017, this is often my answer. 
Somewhere between magical realism, science fiction, and social critique.

### Effective Python
Not much new, but a very good overview of good practices in Python for 
intermediate programmers looking to get started with more advanced techniques.
If you use Python at work, don't know what a "dunder method" is, and want to
improve your Python knowledge, I highly recommend reading this.

### The Sun Also Rises, Ernest Hemingway
It took some time to get going, but by the end it was captivating.

### Inimitable Jeeves
### Very Good, Jeeves
### Right Ho, Jeeves!
If you've never read any P.G. Wodehouse, I highly encourage to go out and
order any of his Jeeves novels right now. Set in England, they're entertaining
farces about the life and exploits of a member of London's idle rich, Bertie
Wooster, and his butler, Jeeves. They're perfect before-bed reading.

### General Systems Thinking, Gerald Weinberg
A more rigorous treatment of the same subject as The Systems Bible, this is
a book to which I expect I'll often return. Highly recommended for anyone
with an interest in the scientific method.

> In just the first few moments of thumbing through its pages, I could see
that this was an attempt to step away from the entire range of scientific
and technological endeavors and ask, “What’s going on here?”

From http://neglectedbooks.com/?p=173, which I found while searching for
reviews of this book, and just may be my favorite new website.

### Confederacy of Dunces
Several people to whom I've talked about this book found it revolting when
they tried reading it. I found it a highly enjoyable tale about wholly
unlikeable characters, but can understand why someone might viscerally dislike it.

### Too Like the Lightning
### Seven Surrenders
Too Like the Lightning is an engaging sci-fi novel, mixed with Enlightment
philosophy and some fantasy. I binge-read both it and its sequel, Seven Surrenders,
over separate 24-hour periods. The sequel isn't quite as good, but still
worthwhile.

### A Personal Anthology, Borges
Deeply weird and thought-provoking short stories, plus short essays and poems,
this collection was chosen by Jorge Luis Borges as the works he wanted his
legacy judged by. This was perfectly suited to be read on the bus on the way
to and from work.

### Hard-boiled Wonderland
Highly enjoyable and deeply original. There's two separate storylines that
eventually join together; in one of them, there's a single small town,
alone and surrounded by wilderness, where in order to enter, the gatekeeper
must cut your shadow off and leave it outside.

### Forest Unseen
I had read most of this a couple years ago, and picked it up and finished
it this year. A series of short essays on nature, spurred by repeated
visits to the same one-foot circle of forest in Tennessee, by a biologist.
Anyone who loves nature and natural history will enjoy this book.

### Proust and the Squid
A book on the neurology of reading, as well as an exploration of dyslexia,
of which I have a variant. I found it quite interesting.

### Dark Forest
The sequel to the Three Body Problem, I found it almost as good, and I'm looking
forward to the third. What I liked most about this book, beyond the excellent
action sequences, was the highly original theories on how alien species
might interact in a crowded universe.

### Deaths End
The finale to the trilogy started by Three Body Problem. It starts very
strong, but somewhat peters out, which is a shame because the scope and
scale of the book keep increasing into the vastness of possibilities of
the universe. I don't think I've read a sci-fi book with a grander scope.

### Merchant of Venice
I forgot just how anti-semitic this play was. Still an enjoyable comedy,
but wow, times have certainly changed since Shakespeare's era.

### The Tempest
I remember this being my favorite play by Shakespeare when I was in high school,
and this rereading didn't disappoint.

### King Lear
A timeless tale of pride and pathos.

### For Whom The Bell Tolls
My favorite book by Hemingway. The denouement at the canyon bridge is one of
the most tense, gripping scenes in anything I've read. What I like about this
book is how most of the book is spent building up a variety of characters
then shows the inevitable reactions when they're put into a series of 
situations. The writing is stripped down but evocative.

### The Book Of Tea
Some time back, someone important to me introduced me to the pleasures of tea,
especially the variety of loose leaf teas available. This pleasant, short book,
by a Japanese intellectual for an American audience, discusses the history, 
rituals, and aesthetics of tea preparation.

This book is likely most interesting to people who are: inclined towards eastern
mysticism, the poetic aesthics of the Romantic and pastoral poets, and
tea drinkers.

> Meanwhile, let us have a sip of tea. The afternoon glow is brightening the 
bamboos, the fountains are bubbling with delight, the soughing of the pines is
heard in our kettle. Let us dream of evanescence, and linger in the beautiful
foolishness of things.

### I Am A Strange Loop, Douglas Hofstadter
I had a close friend move to Berlin this year; we had hoped to have a final
get-together, but never did. I happened to be at the airport, on my way to
San Francisco, when I saw him ahead of me in the security line. We were able
to spend an hour hanging out in the airport, and since he knew my interest in
this sort of book, he gave me I Am a Strange Loop, which he had just finished.

I'm a total sucker for that sort of happy happenstance, and it made an already
great book even better. This is a book for the people who think it's really
interesting what happens when you point a video camera at the television it's
hooked up to, or two mirrors in front and behind you, such that you see an
infinity of reflections, alternating between front and back views. It's
an attempt at one definition of consciousness, based on self-referential
patterns.

Written by the author of Godel, Escher, Bach, in many ways this is a sequel,
20+ years later. It's completely nontechnical, and accessible to anyone with an
intellectual curiousity into what it means to be concsious.

### Mind And Nature
Gregory Bateson is perhaps the most thought-provoking writer I've encountered.
If I was to be stuck on a desert island with just one book, this book could be
in my top five. He has a knack for making incredibly profound, original
insights appear obvious and intuitive. The first half of this book should be
required reading at the high school senior or college freshman level. The
second half is unfortunately very dry and academic; it's going to take
multiple readings before I'm able to properly summarize it.

The book starts by taking a series of intuitive observations of the surrounding
natural world, and developing them into highly original insights. It then
proposes a definition of mind, and provides a perspective of nature that
satisfies that definition. It provides both a theory of mind, and a theory of
evolution, that consists of loops across two different levels of abstraction.

If you've ever been intrigued by cybernetics, this would be a good book to
check out.

> A man wanted to know about mind, not in nature, but in his private large computer. He asked it (no doubt in his best Fortran), "Do you compute that you will ever think like a human being?" The machine then set to work to analyze its own computational habits. Finally, the machine printed its answer on a piece of paper, as such machines do. The man ran to get the answer and found, neatly typed, the words:
>        THAT REMINDS ME OF A STORY

> Prospero says, "We are such stuff as dreams are made on," and surely he is nearly right. It is as if the stuff of which we are made were totally transparent and therefore imperceptible and as if the onlly appearances of which we can be aware are cracks and planes of fracture in that transparent matrix. Dreams and percepts and stories are perhaps cracks and irregularities in the uniform and timeless matrix. Was this what Plotinus meant by an "invisible and unchanging beatury which pervades all things"?


### Seveneves
For Neal Stephenson's entire career, he's been in need of a good editor. He's
great at setting up a novel, but just can't bring himself to end them. This is
a fantastic, action-packed imagination of what might happen if humanity has
just one year before all life on Earth will be destroyed by meteorites
(loose paraphrase). Structurally, it consists of three separate acts: humanity's
attempts to escape into space before the catastrophe; life in space; the return
to earth. The first two acts are both excellent. The third is forgettable.

### Modern China
Last year I read The Three Body Problem, a science fiction book that starts
during the Cultural Revolution, and mentioned I wanted to learn more about
Chinese history. A coworker recommended and loaned this book, which was an
excellent overview of the past few centuries. Highly readable with an excellent
sense of narrative, it was exactly what I was looking for.

### Andy Grove: The Life and Times of an American
Upon reading the news of his death, I picked up this biography, hoping to learn
some lessons from one of the 20th century's most accomplished technologists.
Although well written, I found High Output Management, written by Andy Grove
himself, far more suited to my aims. 

### Exercises in Style, Raymond Queaneau
Goofy little book of wordplay. The same little scenario played out in many
different styles. Translated from the French, which must have been a
creative feat in itself.

### Iliad
The Iliad covers the siege of Troy, and comes before the Odyssey. Amazingly 
bloody, but very well written and translated. When I first began reading,
I wondered why I had read the Odyssey in high school, but not the Iliad.
Pretty quickly, the sheer quantity of blood, gore and death made the answer
obvious.

### Ludwig Wittgenstein: The Duty of Genius
Gave a great view into the man behind the philosophy. I first read
Tractatus, then this, and will next attempt Philosophical Investigations.
I think that's a great way to order these, although Tractatus may be
skippable.

### Technical Leadership, Gerald Weinberg
A seminar in a book, the questions at the end of each chapter are almost
as valuable as the rest of the book combined. I can recommend this book
to anyone looking to increase their technical mastery of almost any skill, from
software development to logging to knitting.

### Behind Closed Doors
Worth reading, but not highly recommended, a book on technical management
of software development.

### MySQL Stored Programs
You should only read this book if you already know you need it. It was very
helpful for rapidly getting me up to speed in a new job that makes heavy use
of stored procedures in MySQL. It's also 10 years old. If your knowledge of
SQL is limited to writing straightfoward queries of existing tables, this
may be a good next step towards building architectures making heavy use of
SQL databases.

### Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves
I'll be very sad the day I've finished everything written by P.G. Wodehouse.
Until then I'll always have something to look forward to reading. This book
is a single narrative, instead of a series of vignettes. I slightly prefer
the vignettes.
